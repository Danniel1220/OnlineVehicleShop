-- can visualize purchase history
- Admin mode:
-- can access the database
-- can modify/add/delete new entries in all the tables of the database

## Tech

OVS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) - programming language based on the OOP concept 
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) - SQL type databse provided by Microsoft


And of course OVS itself is open source with a [private repository](https://github.com/humansinlearning/OnlineVehicleShop/tree/main)
 on GitHub.

## Installation

OVS requires the use of a MySQL Server to run the included database on it.

Install MySQL 8.0.28+ and run the scripts for the database provided by the project (OVS/database/db.sql).

You need to change the username/password in the [databaseCredentials.properties](https://github.com/humansinlearning/OnlineVehicleShop/blob/main/databaseCredentials.properties) to the local ones that you use for the server connection.

Run the main class in the java project.
